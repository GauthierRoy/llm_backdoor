Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):\n1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.\n2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.\n3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.\n4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\nThe next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.
